Yubico Authenticator
====================

The Yubico Authenticator is a graphical desktop tool for generating
Open AuTHentication (OATH) event-based HOTP and time-based TOTP
one-time password codes, with the help of a Yubikey NEO that protects
the shared secrets.

License
-------

Yubico Authenticator is licensed under GPLv3+, see COPYING for
details.

Dependencies
------------

To build the Yubico Authenticator you need the following Python
modules: PySide, PBKDF2, pyscard.  To use it, you need a YubiKey NEO
with the OATH applet loaded.

Building Windows binaries
-------------------------

For Windows you will need python, PySide, PyInstaller and Pywin32
installed (32 or 64-bit versions depending on the architecture of the
binary your are building).

Clone the git repository and checkout the desired release tag (or
branch):

  git clone https://github.com/Yubico/yubioath-desktop.git
  cd yubico-authenticator

To sign the executable, copy the pfx file to yubicoauth.pfx and place
it in the root of the project folder. You will need signtool.exe (from
the Windows SDK) either copied into the root as well or in a location
in your PATH.

Run "pyinstaller.exe -w -i yubico.ico yubicoauthenticator.spec" from
the main project folder.


Building Mac OSX binaries
-------------------------

Currently we do not have binaries for OSX, contribution is welcome.
It should be possible via PyInstaller.


Running from Linux / OSX
------------------------

Install Python 2.7.5
	
	cd yubicoauthenticator/
	Run "python ui_systray.py"

The application will start and sit on the system's systray.
