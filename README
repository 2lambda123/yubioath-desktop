== Yubico Authenticator
The Yubico Authenticator is a graphical desktop tool for generating Open
AuTHentication (OATH) event-based HOTP and time-based TOTP one-time password
codes, with the help of a Yubikey that protects the shared secrets.

=== Installation
TODO: Binaries/PPA do not yet exist!
The recommended way to install this software including dependencies is by using
the provided precompiled binaries for your platform. For Windows and OS X,
there are installers available for download
https://developers.yubico.com/yubioath-desktop/Releases/[here]. For Ubuntu we
have a custom PPA with a package for it
https://launchpad.net/~yubico/+archive/ubuntu/stable[here].

=== Dependencies
Yubico Authenticator requires PySide, yubikey-personalization, pyscard, and
PyCrypto.

=== Building binaries
Binaries for Windows and OSX are built using PyInstaller.

Get the source release file, yubioath-desktop-<version>.tar.gz, and extract it.
It should contain a single directory, henceforth refered to as the release
directory.

When building binaries for Windows or OS X, you will need to include
.dll/.dylib files from the yubikey-personalization project. Create a
subdirectory called "lib" in the release directory. Download the correct binary
release for your architecture from
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/Releases/[here] and
extract the contained .dll/.dylib files to the "lib" directory you created
previously.

==== Windows
For Windows you will need python, PySide, pyscard, PyCrypto, PyInstaller and
Pywin32 installed (32 or 64-bit versions depending on the architecture of the
binary your are building).

To sign the executable you will need signtool.exe (from the Windows SDK) either
copied into the root as well or in a location in your PATH, as well as a
certificate in the Windows certificate store that you wish to sign with.

Run "python setup.py executable" from the main release directory.

TODO: NSIS configuration file does not yet exist!
With NSIS installed, a Windows installer will be built as well.

==== OSX
For OSX you need python, pyside, pyscard, pycrypto, and pyinstaller installed.
One way to install these dependencies is by using Homebrew and pip:

  brew install python
  brew install pyside
  pip install PyInstaller
  pip install pycrypto
  pip install pyscard

NOTE: Homebrew will build backwards-incompatible binaries, so the resulting
build will not run on an older version of OSX.

Run "python setup.py executable" from the main release directory. This
will create an .app in the dist directory.

Sign the code using codesign:

  codesign -s 'Developer ID Application' dist/Yubico\ Authenticator.app --deep

TODO: Packages configuration file does not yet exist!
There is also a project file for use with
http://s.sudre.free.fr/Packaging.html[Packages] located at
`resources/yubioath.pkgproj`. This can be used to create an installer for
distribution, which you should sign prior to distribution:

  packagesbuild resources/osx-installer.pkgproj
  productsign --sign 'Developer ID Installer' dist/Yubico\ Authenticator.pkg dist/yubioath-desktop-mac.pkg
